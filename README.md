# Thresholding-Segmentation-from-scratch
Images segmentation by thresholding using Otsu's method, and RGB to intensity conversion using various methods. Through this project I didn't use any advanced libraries (such as numpy, pandas, etc) for computations and algorithms. Libraries are used ONLY for reading/displaying images and plots.
